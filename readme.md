# Perceived Loudness Analysis

This Python script calculates the perceived loudness of sound by analyzing its frequency components and applying psychoacoustic sensitivity factors (e.g., Fletcher-Munson curves). It is designed for analyzing sound effects, audio clips, or other `.wav` files to understand how different frequencies contribute to perceived loudness.

## Background

This script is part of a broader research project exploring the relationship between the physical properties of sound (e.g., pressure, frequency) and human perception of loudness. The research aims to answer the question: *Why do some sounds feel louder than others, even when measured at the same decibel level?* By integrating sound wave propagation equations and psychoacoustic models, the study seeks to develop a unified framework for predicting perceived loudness. 

The script allows for practical applications of this research by providing a way to analyze real-world sounds, such as sound effects, engine noises, or animal calls, and compare their perceived loudness based on frequency sensitivity and physical intensity.

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy librosa scipy matplotlib

	2.	Place your .wav file (e.g., a sound effect or audio clip) in the project directory.
	3.	Run the script, specifying your file:

python perceived_loudness.py


	4.	View the results, which display the perceived loudness at different frequencies.

Example

For a sound effect file named explosion.wav, the output will show:

Frequency: 500.00 Hz, Perceived Loudness: 78.15 dB
Frequency: 1000.00 Hz, Perceived Loudness: 84.42 dB
Frequency: 5000.00 Hz, Perceived Loudness: 90.13 dB

Use this tool to compare perceived loudness across different sound effects or frequencies.
